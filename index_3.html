            <h3>
                2018 - "Beddy-Bye" - our flagship product is released.
                <br /><br />
                2019 - "Best New Product" - Enterprise Ireland. (Beddy-Bye)
                <br /><br />
                2019 - "Beddy-Bye" improved model.
                <br /><br />f
                Like most projects "Beddy-Bye" began with a question "Is there a product that can help parents at bed-time?"
                We gathered parent groups, child psychologists and technical advisors together and "Beddy-Bye" was born.
                In March 2018 our flagship product "Beddy-Bye" was realised and entered the European market.
                Production of the first prototype began, and first sales landed in July. It was clear we had stumbled into an untapped market.
                <br /><br />
                The feedback we recieved was unanimous. "Beddy-Bye" worked, but could it do more? The team came back together and iterations and more features were added.
                the robot voice you'll be glad to know was finally gotten rid of and replaced by lullaby's. We have added temperature control after many suggestions from you, our cherished customers via our product surveys.
                You can now also select what colour your "Beddy-Bye" should be.
                <br /><br />
                Although initially inspired by various baby monitors, it has always been our intention for "Beddy-Bye" to assist with your baby's sleep.
                Creating the perfect peaceful and serene environment suited to your baby's bed-time sleep.
                We absolutely do not want "Beddy-Bye" to replace mummy and daddy, just help them so all can get a better night sleep.
                Mummy and daddy should still read the lovely stories, laugh and play before baby's bed-time. Then "Beddy-Bye" can start and become your companion.
                <br /><br />

            <h3>
                We started Drift in 2010 but we have had an active interest in improving the sleeping patterns of infants and adults for much longer. Once a group of tired parents and tech specialists, we now want to help parents who are disturbed throughout the night with an ecclectic mix of smart technology, sleeping aids and mindfulness. We want to use smart technology to optimise you and your baby's sleeping time.

                <br /><br />

                Whilst this objective has been at the core of our venture, our mission is to improve the experience of parenthood and deliver innovation to the global audience.
